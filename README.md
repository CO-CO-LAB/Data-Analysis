# Movie Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio project analyzes the 10,000 most popular movies using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The purpose is to showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL  
- Power BI (in progress)

### Key Findings:
1. The number of movies released per year has grown steadily since 2000.
2. Drama and Action are the most popular genres by revenue and rating.
3. Top-rated movies tend to have a lower average budget than the highest-grossing movies.

### Folder Structure:
- `/data`: Contains the cleaned dataset used for analysis.
- `/scripts`: Python and SQL code used to clean, query, and analyze the data.
- `/visuals`: Includes key plots and visualizations generated by the analysis.
- `/reports`: A detailed PDF summary of the analysis and key insights.
